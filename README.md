This tool allows users to easily revert their Grand Theft Auto IV installation (versions 1.2.0.30 and up) from Steam or Rockstar Games Launcher to earlier versions such as 1.0.8.0, 1.0.7.0, or 1.0.4.0.  
This downgrading process is often pursued to enhance mod compatibility, improve game performance, or restore certain features present in earlier versions.  

For more information, check out either the GTA IV Downgrader thread on GTAForums or LCPDFR. Links can be found down below.

## Downgrader Data
The downgrader downloads larger files such as the Game and/or Radio Downgrader from my [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/zuajbnikbkc6z6rr7kzuc/AGt4xhhdNFg0JD5bl3EqWss?rlkey=hjigz9l519et260clkuz0proq&e=2).  
For smaller things such as mods or data, a seperate [GitHub](https://github.com/ClonkAndre/GTAIVDowngraderOnline_Files) repo is used.
