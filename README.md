This tool allows you to easily downgrade the Steam/RGL Complete Edition (1.2.0.32 and up) of GTA IV to either 1.0.8.0, 1.0.7.0 or 1.0.4.0!

There will be 2 versions of this tool, one is the offline downgrader, this downgrader won't download any file from the internet.

This downgrader is 1,6GB big because it already includes everything, and because it can't download anything from the internet. And there will be the online downgrader, that version of the downgrader will download files from the internet, and will also update them while you're downgrading your game if they are old. This downgrader will be significantly smaller.
